### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a 20 year old programmer who finds it difficult to stick to one thing, so you will find me working on all sorts of things! <br />
Currently trying to write compilers using Golang, let's see how that goes.

Let's talk about computers, finance and music.

Fun fact: I don't care as much about good code as I do about good teams.
