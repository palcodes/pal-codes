### Hi there 👋
I am a 21 year old programmer who you will find working on all sorts of tech! <br />
I like to code, cook, run. I believe in FOSS 🌐. <br />
Currently trying to build the habit of writing, so that I can do it more often and feel more in sync with my thoughts & ideas. Soon will link the under-progress blog here. 

Let's talk about computers, finance and music.

Fact: I don't care as much about good code as I do about good teams.
