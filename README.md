### Hi there 👋
The product engineer at [Market](https://market.xyz), trying my best to understand defi, web3  on the frontline.<br />
I like to code, cook, run. I believe in FOSS and an open decentralized internet🌐. <br />
Currently trying to build the habit of writing, so that I can do it more often and feel more in sync with my thoughts & ideas. ~~Soon will link the under-progress blog here.~~ Check out the early writings at [pal.codes](https://pal.codes)

Let's talk about computers, finance, fitness and music.

Fact: I don't care as much about good code as I do about good teams. The former is a by-product.
